          <p><strong>Here's a list of stuff I like and want more people to like with me. Please like this stuff.</strong></p>
          <hr>
          <a href="https://archipelago.gg"><h1>Archipelago</h1></a>
          <img src="https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/archipelago.png"  alt="Archipelago logo">
          <p>Have you played a video game? Do you have friends who have played a video game? Well then hoooo boy do I have something for you to try. Archipelago is a collection of mods for +40 games that allows an uncapped number of players to work together across multiple different games! It does this by replacing items in all the games and shuffling them around, so all the players must work together to find each others tools to get to the finish. It has a lot of set-up, but trust me, it is SO worth it.</p>
          <hr>
          <a href='https://pso2.com/lp/'><h1>Phantasy Star Online 2</h1></a>
          <img src="https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/wokepso2.png"  alt="risa stare">
          <p>While the original release is still better in my opinion, the new and shiny New Genesis makes the series transition into an open world, which is still fun as hell. No more Emergency Codes, instead you'll be waiting until you hear Trial Start to begin grinding for your shiny rainbow loot explosion. The future magic space vibes are indeed immaculate. Join the Pog Champions, we're always scouting... Hearts to all my fellow Summoner mains, I miss my pets &lt;3</p>
          <hr>
          <a href='https://www.usagundamstore.com'><h1>Gunpla</h1></a>
          <img src="https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/gundam.jpg"  alt="gundam build kit spread across a workspace">
          <p>Usually in the form of Gundam, mech robot dudes that have way too much lore and drama than I can be bothered to keep up with, Gunpla is a series of model kits that you cut out of plastic frames and put together to get some kinda action figure by the end. Sometimes stickers need placed, most need nippers, and an exacto knife can always be handy. You can care as much or as little as you want, filing down rough cuts and detailing with an airbrush or paint marker is common, but do whatever as long as you're enjoying it. FYI I have seen maybe 2 episodes of the anime, I just think the mechs look cool.</p>
          <hr>
          <a href='https://en.onepiece-cardgame.com'><h1>One Piece TCG</h1></a>
          <img src="https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/BuggyPosting.png"  alt="buggy the clown">
          <p>What's this? One of the best anime with the greatest world-building has a collectable card game now? AND it's actually fun to play??? Sign me up please! Personally I run a Big Mom deck because I'm a loser that likes being able to tank hits and not have to play around needing an endless number of blockers and counters. If you aren't into One Piece but you like card games, I still recommend this, it's a fun one and pretty straightforward once you get a feel for it after your first couple turns. If you like One Piece but aren't sure about playing a card game, test out a starter deck or try out the online simulator and see if it's for you! No need to go deep if you don't have to.</p>
          <hr>
          <a href='https://hello.vrchat.com'><h1>VRChat</h1></a>
          <img src="https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/vrchat.jpg" alt="group of avatars gathering for a picture in vrchat">
          <p>Worry not, you don't HAVE to have VR to play, in fact I played for about a year before I ended up getting a headset. It's exactly what it sounds like, but way more. Most of the experience is going to chill worlds and hanging out with either friends or people you just met who are about to become your friends. Try to steer clear of lobbies that are huge, for performance reasons as well as to avoid trolls who are just out to disrupt whatever you have going on. Aside from just chatting, there are actual huge worlds worth exploring for hours, you just have to do some world hopping for a bit and I'm sure you'll find some place incredible you've never stumbled across before. There are also plenty of games to play and fun Udon experiences to try out. Once you play you'll see why this game is constantly the reason behind people pushing the boundaries of what VR is capable of, both in hardware and software.</p>
          <hr>
          <a href='https://www.kidicaruswiki.org/wiki/Kid_Icarus:_Uprising'><h1>Kid Icarus: Uprising</h1></a>
          <img src='https://dog-sama.neocities.org/images/viridi.png'  alt="the goddess of nature viridi">
          <p>This has everything a great game needs; incredible story with tons of hilarious dialogue, memorable characters, bangin' soundtrack, tight controls, tons of replay value, crazy in-depth crafting system that you can either spend hours optimizing or completely ignore, online multiplayer, and a unique gameplay experience that nothing else can really satisfy. This game NEEDS a sequel, because honestly just a port wouldn't be doing it justice. Don't forget about the collectable AR Cards, some places still sell them online so stock up while you can.</p>
